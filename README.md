Number: Employee number
Position: Job role or position
Age: Employee age
Height: Employee height (in cm)
Weight: Employee weight (in lbs)

Analysis Tasks
The following analysis tasks were performed:

Employee Distribution Across Teams:

Counted employees in each team and calculated their percentage of the total.
This allowed for an understanding of team size distribution across the company.
Employee Segregation by Position:

Grouped employees by position to observe job role distributions.
This identified the most common roles and offered insight into workforce structure.
Predominant Age Group:

Segmented employees into age ranges (20-30, 31-40, etc.) to determine the most common age group.
This clarified the age demographics of the workforce.
Team and Position with Highest Salary Expenditure:

Calculated total salary expenditure by both team and position to identify the highest spenders.
This highlighted where the company invests the most financially, which may inform budgeting decisions.
Correlation Between Age and Salary:

Analyzed the correlation between age and salary to understand if age impacts compensation.
This provided insight into salary trends across different age groups.
Graphical Representations
Each analysis task was accompanied by visualizations to effectively communicate findings:

Employee Distribution by Team: Bar chart showcasing team sizes.
Employee Segregation by Position: Pie chart representing the count of employees by job role.
Age Group Distribution: Bar of employees in various age ranges.
Salary Expenditure by Team and Position: Stacked bar chart of salary costs by team and position.
Age vs. Salary Correlation: Scatter plot illustrating the relationship between age and salary.
These visualizations provide an intuitive understanding of the workforce structure, financial allocations, and demographic trends.

Insights and Data Story
The analysis revealed the following key insights:

Workforce Distribution:

Most teams have a balanced number of employees, with slight variations in team sizes.
The New Orleans Pelicans had the highest number of employees, comprising about 4.15% of the total workforce.
Position Distribution:

Certain key roles (e.g., SG for Shooting Guard, PG for Point Guard) are the most common, which aligns with the organization’s focus on specific skills.
Age Demographics:

The predominant age group is 20-30 years, indicating a youthful workforce.
Understanding this distribution helps align company resources and employee benefits to match the needs of a younger workforce.
Salary Expenditure:

Specific teams and positions incur the highest salary costs, which can inform budgeting and financial planning.
This information is valuable for identifying positions that are more financially demanding.
Age-Salary Relationship:

A slight positive correlation was found between age and salary, though other factors seem to influence salary more significantly than age alone.
The scatter plot further demonstrated variability in salary across age groups, suggesting salary adjustments are not solely based on age.

Additional Information
This analysis not only provides insights into the company’s employee demographics and financial allocation but also serves as a model for future data analyses. Each analysis task, along with its visualization, is designed to help ABC Company make data-driven decisions regarding workforce management and resource optimization.
